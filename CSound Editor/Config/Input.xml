<!-- Instructions and conventions:
	Important!! EDITOR state is not implemented yet. Use GAMEPLAY and MENU for the moment.

	To add a new key binding, add an <action> node to a certain state.
	The <action> node must contain one <key> or <mouse> child, and one <event> child.
	It can also contain a <special> child, which defines the special keys held down
	in that specific combination, using attributes (for example <special CTRL=""></special>
	would mean that the key combination also has CTRL pressed down).
	
	The <event> child should be a string, preferably with lowercase characters and underscores.
	
	Conventions for keys:
	- letter keys are just capital letters: A-Z
	- number keys are just the numbers 0-9.
	- F keys are just F and a number: F1-F12
	- special keys are CTRL, ALT and SHIFT. 
	- other available keys: ENTER, ESCAPE, SPACE, TAB
	
	Conventions for mouse buttons:
	- LEFT, RIGHT, MIDDLE for the usual buttons
	- for mouse buttons 4 through 8, just the number: 4-8
